Sneaky Actor Switching Demo

===================
Introduction
===================
This demo presents a simple way to include a greater number on interactable objects in GB Studio.
Provided said objects are completely stationary.
This is useful when you want to have a large number of objects players’ can examine,
or just want to conserve resources for more important actors.

===================
Implementation
===================
This system works by having all relevant objects depicted in the background with actors with
invisible sprites (feel free to use the empty.png file if you don’t feel like making one)
set on top to handle the interactions.

Each relevant actor handles the interactions of multiple in-game objects via switching its position
when the player approaches the objects.

The scene is divided into multiple sectors with triggers changing the position of the invisible
actors and the “sector” variable.

The sector variable is used to determine what happens when an actor is interacted with.

When interacted with, each relevant actor runs an IF function to check the currently-active sector
and executes the function for the object it represents in that sector.

The demo provides two different types of actor switching setups.
-------------------
Boundary Switching
-------------------
Boundary switching works by cutting the scene in half with two triggers.
This is best for when you have fewer objects spread out over the scene.
The trigger on each side switches to that sector. The triggers can be adjacent to each other,
but if the player is standing on both only one activates (I believe the newest one).
Check the scene’s navigation, the higher listed trigger will have priority…
or just don’t put objects where they can be interacted with while standing on both triggers.

-------------------
Area Switching
-------------------
Area switching works by grouping objects together within triggers,
making it much easier to segment the scene into more than two and/or uneven sectors.
This is best for when you have a large number of objects that can be grouped together
(for example, multiple rows of shelves in a shop).

-------------------
The Switcher
-------------------
The Switcher is an optional element, but one that can help keep things orderly.
The Switcher is an invisible actor with a script to check for the currently-active sector
and set the position of all the relevant actors.
This keeps all the actor position switching events in one place and allows for triggers
to only need to set the sector variable and invoke The Switcher.

===================
 Additional Notes
===================
- Don’t forget to put collisions on free-standing objects.
  While the player won’t be able to reach them while inactive, other wandering actors can.

- Make sure the sector that the player starts in is active by default
  or set during Scene Start or Switch Scene scripts.
  This is really only an issue for boundary switching.

- Set all actor switching events to run only if the scene being switched to is not currently active.
  Failing to do so will run the switching script with every step the player takes within the trigger,
  causing noticeable slowdown.

Thanks for checking out the Sneaky Actor Switching Demo, if you found it helpful then…
well good, that was the general idea.
If you use these techniques in your project feel free to give me a shoutout… or not,
I don’t really care.
